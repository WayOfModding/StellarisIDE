/**
 * Limited-purpose range classes
 *
 * <p>These classes are modeled on Guava's {@link
 * com.google.common.collect.Range}, but only cover a small subset of its
 * functionalities.</p>
 *
 * <p>The motivation, particularly for {@link
 * com.github.fge.largetext.range.IntRange}, is to make {@link
 * java.lang.CharSequence#charAt(int)} cheaper; in {@link
 * com.github.fge.largetext.LargeText}, for performance reasons, the latest
 * loaded character buffer is kept in memory, along with its absolute range in
 * the file; when {@code charAt()} is called, it is checked that the character
 * index is within the current range.</p>
 *
 * <p>This was done using {@link
 * com.google.common.collect.Range#contains(Comparable)}, but since {@code
 * Range} does not have primitives as arguments, it was autoboxing the {@code
 * int} value each time; when this operation is called nearly a hundred million
 * times per <em>second</em> in the worst case scenarios, the cost becomes
 * significant. {@code IntRange}'s {@code .contains()} does not do such
 * autoboxing (it does not have to).</p>
 *
 * <p>And while this makes things faster, the bigger gain is actually in memory
 * usage!</p>
