/**
 * The "thread shepherd" for a text decoding operation
 *
 * <p>This class handles two types of callers:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>callers to {@link CharSequence#charAt(int)} and {@link
 *     CharSequence#subSequence(int, int)}, via {@link CharWaiter}s;</li>
 *     <li>callers to {@link CharSequence#length()}, via its {@link
 *     #getTotalSize()} method.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The callers of the first two charsequence operations only need to wait for
 * a given number of characters to be (successfully!) decoded, while the callers
 * of the third need to wait for the whole decoding process to (successfully,
 * again) terminate.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class maintains the first category of callers using a {@link
 * PriorityQueue} of {@link CharWaiter} instances, and the second category with
 * a single {@link CountDownLatch}.</p>
 *
 * <p>There is one such class per {@link LargeText} instance. It is created,
 * and updated by, the (also unique) {@link TextDecoder} instance which is the
 * decoding workhorse.</p>
 *
 * <p>See the documentation of each method for details on the inner workings.
 * </p>

 * @see TextDecoder#needChars(int)
