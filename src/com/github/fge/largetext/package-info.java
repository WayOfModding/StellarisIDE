/**
 * Main user interface
 *
 * <p>Start by building a {@link com.github.fge.largetext.LargeTextFactory},
 * then use it to obtain {@link com.github.fge.largetext.LargeText} instances.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>You will need to create a {@link java.nio.file.Path} to the file you wish
 * to use, for instance using {@link java.nio.file.Paths#get(String, String...)}
 * if your file is on the "main" filesystem; but this will work with any path
 * from any filesystem, as long as this filesystem has {@link
 * java.nio.channels.SeekableByteChannel} support (see {@link
 * java.nio.file.Files#newByteChannel(java.nio.file.Path,
 * java.nio.file.OpenOption...)}).</p>
